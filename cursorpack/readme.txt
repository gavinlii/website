Author's description:

Linux cursor theme based on WinClassic 3D Silver theme.

(Don't mind the duplicated roles, as they are important for a Linux cursor theme to work!)

If you can make the theme work on Linux (as I am unable to), DM me!

Made with love and help with [[user/118501|CursorCollectonist]], and we will also develop a 3D Gold, 3D Cyan and Classic Mix theme as well.
